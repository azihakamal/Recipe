            <h1>Welcome to the Recipe Collection</h1>
            <p>I’m so glad you’re here. Whether you’re looking to explore a vegan lifestyle,
            searching for plant-based recipes, or hoping to develop a more compassionate relationship
            with food, it’s my hope that this blog will have something to offer you.
            

            Eating can be complicated, especially in this day and age. We’re all hoping to eat responsibly,
            healthfully, and well, but alarmism, mixed messages, and impossible standards often stand in our way.
            My goal in bringing you The Full Helping is to help you love your body through the experience
            of nourishing, plant-based food. Here you’ll find recipes that are focused on both pleasure and
            wellness, along with occasional musings on nutrition, self-care, and mindful living. </p>
